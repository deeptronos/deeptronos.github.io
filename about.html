    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science.
        After moving to Portland in 2020 to begin college, I'll be graduating
        this year.
        <br />
        In a personal capacity, I've been programming for about as long as I've
        known how to use a computer. As a student, I enjoy studying such an
        active and transformational field, but I've always had a special
        interest in computers. I'm motivated by the power that modern computers
        and computer networks have to improve accessibility, equity, and
        democratize access to the luxuries produced by the incredible technology
        of our time.

        <br />
        In the future, I hope to work with high-performance programming
        languages across multiple platforms and architectures. Over the past few
        years I've become enamoured by Rust, and I hope to be able to explore
        that language in a professional capacity after graduation.
