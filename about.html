    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science.
        After moving to Portland in 2020 to begin college, I'll be graduating
        this year.
        <br />
        In a personal capacity, I've been programming for about as long as I've
        known how to use a computer. As a student, I enjoy studying such an
        active and transformational field, but I've always had a special
        interest in computers. I'm motivated by the power that modern computers
        and computer networks have to improve accessibility, equity, and
        democratize access to the luxuries produced by the incredible technology
        of our time.

        <br />
        In the future, I hope to work with high-performance programming
        languages across multiple platforms and architectures. Over the past few
        years I've become enamoured by Rust, and I hope to be able to explore
        that language in a professional capacity after graduation.

        <!-- . I pursue many CS-related projects in my free time, I have a
        couple of years of professional software engineering experience thanks
        to a lovely internship I had with Nexersys in Austin, TX between 2021
        and 2022. As a young adult entering the workforce, I had my first
        profesional experience in CS at Nexersys in Summer 2021, where I worked
        alongside a very small software enginereing team to improve
        maintainability and add new content to their gym product. I maintained a
        good relationship with Nexersys, and I continued working for Nexersys
        while the next school year came and went. After my first year at
        Nexersys, my work shifted to exploring future improvements to their
        products (LLM-based user recognition, integrating contemporary graphical
        features into their flagship product which ran a very old mobile
        chipset) before returning to school full-time.
