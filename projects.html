                This is a text-based lifestyle/farming video game. In Autumn of
                2020, I spent several weeks creating this as my final project
                for my first-ever college CS class. I was inspired by Stardew
                Valley, Fallout, and Evangelion. This project contains a lot of
                bad programming and messy organization but I'm proud of the fun,
                creative result.

                Last Autumn, I took a digital sound and music course which
                culminated in this project: a program for applying various types
                of distortion to an arbitary sample of audio.
                <br />
                I created this as an actual tool to augment my musical process.
                In my spare time, after computer science, creating and mixing
                music is my passion. I was unsatisfied with the distortion
                capabilities of the existing digital music tools I'm very
                familiar with, so I used a few well-regarded Python libraries to
                make this app. It allows the user apply any standard audio
                distortion you could think of as well as some unique digital
                distortion techniques that aren't available in any commercial
                software. I also used a Python TUI library for the first time in
                this project, so the final result was a unique audio tool that's
                as powerful as it is accessible.

            <h2 class="card-title">Music</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                When I'm not programming, I'm creating music. I write original
                work and edit/remix songs I love. My favorite things to do are
                to introspecitvely dive into myself to write original music, or
                to create a waves of excitement, release, and community in an
                audience I'm DJing for.
                <br />
                The expressiveness, universality, and emotion of audio works is
                a refreshing departure from the alienation that I've felt in the
                wider culture around CS in this anthropocentric moment as a
                young queer person.
                <br />
                The majority of music created over my 10+ years doing this stuff
                is only on my local disks, but what little material I've
                uploaded online can be found at my SoundCloud.
                <br />
                My interests in CS and music often overlap, and you can find
                such an example at the second link below - an app written in
                Godot that plays a shader I ported from ShaderToy in time with a
                music track. In the future, I hope for the chance to integrate
                programatic visuals like these into live or recorded
                performance.
