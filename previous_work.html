        <p>
            In 2024, I took a course on Web Development in Rust. This introduced
            me to the language in a setting I was already familar with - backend
            web dev- and I fell in love with its speed, ergonomics, and optimism
            for the future of programming languages.
            <br />
            After the term, I reached out to the professor of that course in an
            effort to continue learning Rust and was invited to contribute to
            Rust Edu, an educational organization dedicated to supporting the
            adoption of Rust in educational environments. Now, I'm working on
            improving the usability of the organization's materials and am on
            track to do some great work with the organization this year.

            <h2>Software Engineering Intern @ Nexersys (Austin, TX)</h2>

        <p>
            I had my first profesional experience in CS at Nexersys in Summer
            2021, where I worked alongside a very small software enginereing
            team to improve maintainability and add new content to their gym
            product. I maintained a good relationship with Nexersys, and I
            continued working for Nexersys while the next school year came and
            went. After my first year at Nexersys, my work shifted to exploring
            future improvements to their products (LLM-based user recognition,
            integrating contemporary graphical features into their flagship
            product which ran a very old mobile chipset) before returning to
            school full-time.
